TaskTracker is a task management application designed to help users organize, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. It features a user-friendly interface with a sleek design that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks seamlessly.

I. Key Features:

1. Task Management: Easily add new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks that are no longer needed.

2. Status Tracking: Assign status to tasks to keep track of their progress, such as "To Do", "In Progress", or "Done".

3. User Assignment: Assign tasks to specific users to ensure accountability and collaboration.

4. Stylish Interface: The application features a stylish toolbar with gradient background and custom-styled buttons for an enhanced user experience.

II. Frontend: Angular

1. Angular Framework: The frontend of the TaskTracker app is built using Angular, a powerful framework for building dynamic web applications. Angular's component-based architecture ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.

2. Material Design: The app uses Angular Material to provide a sleek and responsive design with pre-built UI components.

3. Reactive Forms: Angular's FormsModule is used to manage form inputs, validation, and submission, making it easy for users to add and edit tasks.

III. Backend: .NET Core with MongoDB

1. MongoDB: The backend uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB stores task data in a JSON-like format, which aligns well with the structure of the application.

2. .NET Core: The backend services are implemented using .NET Core, a cross-platform framework for building robust and scalable web APIs. The services handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.

3. Dependency Injection: .NET Core's built-in dependency injection is used to manage service dependencies, ensuring a clean and testable codebase.

IV. API Documentation: Swagger    

1. Swagger: Swagger is integrated into the backend to provide interactive API documentation. It allows developers to explore and test API endpoints directly from the browser.

2. API Testing: With Swagger UI, you can test API endpoints without needing a separate tool, making it easier to debug and ensure API functionality.

TaskTracker is the perfect tool for individuals and teams looking to stay organized and ensure that all tasks are completed on time.
